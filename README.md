# 🏠 Smart Homeless Shelter Management System using DSA & Graph Algorithms

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Homeless Shelter Management System** is designed to:

- Register and manage homeless people records  
- Calculate priority score based on age, gender, medical condition, and complaint  
- Allocate the nearest shelter using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**  
- Handle emergency cases using **Max Heap (Priority Queue)**  
- Analyze data using reports and statistics  
- Traverse city network using **BFS & DFS**  
- Classify complaints using **Rabin-Karp String Matching**

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Register, update, delete homeless records  
- ✅ Automatic priority calculation system  
- ✅ Nearest shelter allocation using Dijkstra  
- ✅ Emergency management using Max Heap  
- ✅ Shelter capacity management  
- ✅ BFS & DFS network traversal  
- ✅ Complaint keyword detection using Rabin-Karp  
- ✅ Sorting shelters using Merge Sort  
- ✅ Binary search on records  
- ✅ Detailed Analysis & Reports subsystem  
- ✅ Fully menu-driven interface
