📌 Project Overview

The Smart Homeless Shelter Management System is designed to:

Register and manage homeless people records

Calculate priority score based on age, gender, medical condition, and complaint

Allocate the nearest shelter using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Handle emergency cases using Max Heap (Priority Queue)

Analyze data using reports and statistics

Traverse city network using BFS & DFS

Classify complaints using Rabin-Karp String Matching

🎯 Features

✅ Emergency management using Max Heap
✅ Shelter capacity management
✅ BFS & DFS network traversal
✅ Complaint keyword detection using Rabin-Karp
✅ Sorting shelters using Merge Sort
✅ Binary search on records
✅ Detailed Analysis & Reports subsystem
✅ Fully menu-driven interface
